Diabetes Prediction App

Project Overview:

During my internship at Data Glacier in weeks 4 and 5, I took on the role of a Data Analyst/Data Science. As part of this experience, I created a Diabetes Prediction app using Machine Learning, deployed it with Flask, and containerized it using Docker. You can now find the app hosted on Heroku. This repository serves as a detailed guide, walking you through the entire journey of building a machine learning model for predicting diabetes. The process includes handling data preprocessing, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), creating visualizations, training the model, and finally deploying it

Key Steps:

Data Exploration:
I started by importing and understanding the Kaggle diabetes dataset, using Pandas. Explored columns, handled missing values, and checked for duplicates.

Visualization:
Visualized the data to see correlations between features and the final outcome.

Data Preprocessing:
Standardized data to enhance model performance and handled the imbalance in the dataset.

Model Training:
Experimented with various machine learning models like Logistic Regression, KNN, SVC, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to find the best performer.

Model Evaluation:
Assessed model accuracy and chose the Random Forest model with a 76% accuracy.

Deployment:
Faced and overcame challenges while deploying the model using Flask, integrated it with the frontend for user input and prediction. Used Docker for containerization.

Objective:
The main aim is to predict whether a user is likely to have diabetes based on specific input features, enabling early diagnosis and potential preventative measures. This repository showcases the entire process from handling data to deploying the predictive diabetes model.

Tools Used:

Backend:
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Flask, Docker

Frontend:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
